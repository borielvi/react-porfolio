                    <p>
                        My name is Elvin Boring. I am a Web designer and Entreprenuer. Business in all it's facets is my passion. I am very analytical so it helps me to look at every little detail in ever portion of the website design. I spent 6 years in the transportation industry working as a Conductor for the two largest railroad companies in the United States which are Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF Railway. I also spent 6 month's going to the University of Arizona's full-stack coding bootcamp.
